## Business Understanding
Empower Automotive is an app that users can use to help set a price on their used car. They are trying to become a large player in the used car automotive industry. Their goal is to help users analyze what price would be the most accurate, competitive, and successful for selling their cars. We formed key questions to answer in order to provide the stakeholders our best recommendations.

### Key Business Questions
What features are the most important when accurately pricing a car?

What is the relationship between car price and year?

What is the relationship between leather interior and price?

How can Empower Automotive become a trusted source for used car prices?

### Stakeholders
In our analysis we considered a few key stakeholders including:

1. Empower Automotive Executives
2. Car buyers
3. Car sellers

## Data Understanding and Analysis
We examined data from Kaggle Dataset "Car Price Prediction Challenge". We focused on the Price, Prod. year, Leather interior and Mileage features for our models.

### Descriptions of Data
Our first step was to implement some data cleaning in this data set which includes

Replacing null values to 0 or remove them. This allows us to be able to convert data types to float.

### Visualizations and Modeling
We created visualizations to help support our questions and analysis.

Price and Mileage 
This graph shows cars with the lowest mileage have a higher selling price than those with high mileage.




Price and Production Year
This graph shows newer models of cars have a higher selling price than older models. There are some instances where the car is older but has a higher price tag because it is vintage or a one of a kind.




Price and Leather Interior 
This box and whisker plot shows cars with leather interior tend to have higher price tags but the averages of leather vs cloth are similar showing that leather interior does not have that much of a value add when selling used cars.

## Conclusion
We recommend Empower Automotive to use the xxx modeling technique as it proves to be the most accurate.
